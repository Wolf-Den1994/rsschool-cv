## Summary
I am currently working as an electronic engineer in an ice cream factory. My goal is to learn something new for myself, and if there is an opportunity to change my occupation. Before that I studied programming languages, which are very similar to JS, ​​at the university. At the first place of work, I had to learn a new language for me - step 7, which isn't like one of  those that were at the university.  And now, learning JS, I remember the previously accumulated "*knowledge base*", and it brings me pleasure.

## Skills

I started learning html and css about 8 months ago by myself.  Well, I started my acquaintance with JS only on September 6, 2020, on the RSS2020Q3 course. At the university I studied programming languages: C, mikroC, and at work - step 7 (LAD, FBD). I have been using GitHub for over 5 months and posting my work there. There are my projects, examples of practical tasks and work from different intensives.
